# RealMassive API — The API for real-time commercial real estate information

Our mission at RealMassive has always been to open up the data within CRE and improve the intelligence and speed of the industry. With that in mind we’ve developed a fully open API.The RealMassive API gives you real-time access to our nationwide database of commercial real estate listings and related information about this $15.2 trillion industry. What you do with the data is up to you.
Here are a few key ways our API can help you:
  * Quickly search for and retrieve availability information from tens of thousands of commercial real estate listings
  * Create, share, and manage your market surveys
  * Create, share, and manage your organization’s inventory and availability listings

## Quickstart

The RealMassive API is a [RESTful API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) that communicates over the HTTP protocol. Here's what you need to know to get started quickly:
  * **Root endpoint for Testing**: [https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/api/v1](https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/api/v1)
  * **Root endpoint for Production**: [https://www.realmassive.com/api/v1](https://www.realmassive.com/api/v1)
  * **API token**: You’ll need an API token to make API calls. You can apply for one in our [Developer's Area](https://www.realmassive.com/developer-center/). See the API Tokens Section below for using.
  * **API call authorization**: You will use simple authorization (email/password) and/or your API token for API call authorization.
  * **URL encoding**: All requests must be properly URL encoded, including parameters and values.

### A Few Example API Calls
| API Call | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| `GET /api/v1/spaces/:id` | Get the `Space` identified by unique ID, `:id` |
| `GET /api/v1/buildings/:id` | Get the `Building` identified by unique ID, `:id` |
| `GET /api/v1/markets` | Get a list of all `Markets` |
| `GET /api/v1/markets/geo?latitude=30&longitude=-97` | Find `Markets` near (30,-97) with a 100 km radius (central Texas) |
| `GET /api/v1/spaces/search?building.address.city=Austin&building.address.state=TX` | Find all `Spaces` with an Austin, TX address |

Our search is very flexible; see [Advanced Search Examples](#advanced-search-examples)

### How to quickly make a Space
  1. Make sure you have an account on RealMassive or the RealMassive Sandbox server & login to that account
  1. Create a Building using the `/api/v1/buildings` POST route
  1. Store that Building's key when in the previous call's response
  1. Create a Space using the `api/v1/spaces` POST route, passing in `building_key` from the previous step
  1. Store the Spaces's key returned in the previous response.
  1. Now, upload your attachments/cover photos/floorplans using the `/upload` POST route. Make sure you pass in a `target` which is either the building key or
     space key from the previous steps

### Search Syntax and Tips
#### Results Filtering
You can filter search results by providing a list of keyword-value pairs in the request for any field that implements filtering. The next sections
describe how to specify various types of filters.

##### Single Value Filters
Each resource maintains its list of filterable fields (keywords) and values (via the `api/v1/model-name/search/fields` routes). 
An example is that `Spaces` can be filtered by `space_type` (eg. `lease`, `sublease`, `coworking`). To search for all subleases, 
that is Spaces with `space_type` equal to `sublease`, one would perform a GET on `/spaces/search?space_type=sublease`.

##### Filtering on Lists of Values
To filter on a list of values, one can supply that list as a pipe-separated list of quoted values. For example, to find all spaces in Austin 
or San Antonio, one would pass in `market="Austin, TX"|"San Antonio, TX"`.

##### Geospatial Filtering
RealMassive provides two types of geospatial filtering: (1) point and radius; and (2) bounded rectangles.

**Point and Radius Filtering**: To use point-and-radius filtering, add the `geo` search parameter providing, in parenthesis, three values: 
  1. latitude
  1. longitude
  1. radius in meters
For example, to search for markets we serve within a 5k circle around the center of Dallas, TX one would use, `/markets/search?geo=(32.7758,-96.7967,5000)`. 

**Bounded Rectangles Filtering**: To perform geo-queries using this method, a box-bounded geosearch, use the geolocation specified with four parameters: the lat/lon
of two points defining the box in which to search, specified as `building.address.geo.latitude=[MIN:MAX]` and `building.address.geo.longitude=[MIN:MAX]`. (Please note, -97<-96; please ensure MIN is truly less than MAX.)
For example, to search for availabilities inside the thin I-30 corridor between Dallas and Fort Worth,
one would provide the search query, `https://www.realmassive.com/api/v1/spaces/search?building.address.geo.latitude=[30.307:32.307]&building.address.geo.longitude=[-97.7:-96.7]&building.market=ahJzfnJlYWxtYXNzaXZlLXByb2RyEwsSBk1hcmtldBiAgICQgoSOCww`.

##### Ranges
**Bounded Exclusive Ranges**: To filter on a range of values, specify that range in parentheses: `rate=(20:25)`, will search for all rates between 20 and 25 exclusive. 
**Bounded Inclusive Ranges**: Inclusive ranges are specified by placing the extrema in brackets: `rate=[20:25]`, will search for all rates between 20 and 25 inclusive. 
**Unbounded Ranges**: To remove upper or lower bounds on a search, simply remove one of the extremum. For example, to search all rates greater than or equal to 
$20: `rate=[20:]`; and to search for all rates less than 52 dollars use `rate=[:52)`. 

##### Sorting
You can request that search results be ordered in some specific way by using the sort keyword and assigning a value by which to sort. For example, to sort 
Markets by size, one would perform a GET on `/markets/search?sort=size`. To reverse the sorting direction, prepend a “-” to the sorted field . For example,
to reverse the aforementioned sort, one would perform a GET on  `/markets/search?sort=-size`. (Note the - before the word ‘sort’.) To sort on multiple fields,
one can reuse the sort keyword. For example, to sort Markets by `size` and `market_name`, one would perform a GET on `/markets/search?sort=size&sort=market_name`.
In this case, results would be sorted first by size, then by market_name within size. Here, order in the query matters.

#### Tips
1. To discover what fields you can search by, call `/api/v1/model-name/search/fields`. For example, `/api/v1/markets/search/fields`, 
and `/api/v1/spaces/search/fields`.
1. Most models support keyword searching. Perform keyword searches with, `/api/v1/model/search?k=keyword`. For example, `/api/v1/spaces/search?k=CBRE`.

#### <a name="advanced-search-examples"></a> Advanced Search Examples ####
1. This query searches for `Space` in the Austin `Market` that has a rate of $23 to $25 per square foot, inclusive, is a `Sublease`, with results sorted by the available space in ascending order:
  * `GET /spaces/search?market_name=Austin&rate=[23:25]&space_type=sublease&sort=-space_available`
1. This query searches for a `Space` with a rate of $10–$20/SF/YR, in an industrial or flex space building, returning only the building's title, geolocation, and space available, sorted by
   decreasing cost:
  * `GET /spaces/search?search_rate=[10:20]&building.type=industrial,flex&fields=[building.title,building.address.geo.latitude,building.address.geo.longitude,space_available]&sort=-total_cost`
1. This query searches for all submarkets within a 25k raduius around Houston, TX:
  * `GET /markets/submarkets/search?geo=(29.7628,-95.3831,25000)`

### Resources
A resource is a network-accessible data object or service accessed by a uniform resource identifier (URI). A collection is a set of resources. 
Resources are presented as nouns that hopefully make sense to the API consumer. All resources are returned in JSON, unless other formats are 
specifically requested. Relations are used to specialize the results of a resource. For example, `/markets/market-id/submarkets` would return the 
`Submarkets` for the specific `Market` identified by its market-id value.

#### URI Space
The following resources are exposed and accessible via resource URIs.

| Resource | URI | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Buildings | `/buildings` | Represents a physical buildings in our database. |
| Markets | `/markets` | Represents the markets in which we operate. |
| Organizations | `/organizations` | Represents Users' organizations. |
| Portfolios | `/portfolios` | Represents a collection of spaces. |
| Spaces | `/spaces` | Represents and available Space for lease. |
| Users | `/users` | Represents Users on our system. |
| Auth | `/auth` | User authentication. |
| Version | `/version` | API version information. |

## Known Issues
1. Arrays within arrays are incorrectly structured on return. Instead of a list of nested objects, 
the data are returned serialized with the fields. See the example below.

### Proper Response

        {
          "contacts": [
            {
              "first_name": "Joe",
              "last_name": "Agent",
            },
            {
              "first_name": "Jane",
              "last_name": "Broker",
            }
          ]
        }

## Group API Tokens
### Understanding API Tokens
We use API Tokens to identify users making API calls. You can apply for your API Token in our [Developers Area](https://www.realmassive.com/developer-center/). 

We offer two types of token: Development and Production. For Development, your API Token request is immediately granted and you make API calls against [https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/api/v1](https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/api/v1). 
For Production, you make API calls against our root production endpoint: [https://www.realmassive.com/api/v1](https://www.realmassive.com/api/v1). Production applications are reviewed by a RealMasive team member before approval.

The flavor of token we use is the [JSON Web Token (JWT)](http://jwt.io/). JWT is a flexible solution, allowing you to choose from a list of encoding algorithms to suit your needs.

### Using your API Token
  1. Apply for and receive your API token. Your API Token will consist of two parts: a "ClientID" and a "Secret".
  1. Grab a JWT encoding [library for your application language](http://jwt.io/#libraries).
  1. When making API calls, use the above library and your ClientID to encode the relative portion of the URL and all of the request parameters as follows: ```{ 'jti': <client_id>, 'url': <relative_url_plus_params> }``` Don't worry, there's a Python example below.
  1. In your HTTP request set the following two headers: ```X-Authorization: TOKEN-ENCODED-REQUEST``` and ```X-Client-Id: YOUR-CLIENT-ID```
  1. Reap the rewards of the first open API in Commercial Real Estate.

### Example 1.
The following Python example encodes a sample API call. To test this, copy and paste this into a script and set your
Client ID and secret for the Development Environment.
```python
    import jwt
    import requests

    __ENDPOINT = "https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/api/v1"

    __CLIENT_ID = YOUR-CLIENT-ID
    __SECRET = YOUR-SECRET

    def jwt_encode(relative_url, algorithm):
        """Encode the relative URL using the algorithm, 
           Client ID, and secret.
        
           RETURNS
              Request headers as a dictionary appropriate
              for an API call.
        """
        encoded = jwt.encode({'jti': __CLIENT_ID,
                              'url': relative_url},
                             __SECRET,
                             algorithm)
        return {'X-Client-Id': __CLIENT_ID, 
                'X-Authorization': encoded}

    def test():
        url = '/api/v1/markets'
        jwt_headers = jwt_encode(url)
        response = requests.get(__ENCDPONIT + url,
                                headers=jwt_headers)
        assert response.status_code == 200
```

# Group Attachments
To successfully market your availabilities you need beautiful media. `Spaces` and `Buildings` need `Attachments` in the form of images and
movies. Here is how you add images to your `Buildings` or `Spaces`:
  1. Create your `Building` or `Space`
  1. Upon creation, store that object's keystring (aka 'key')
  1. For each image you want to associate with that given `Building` or `Space` you POST that image to the `/upload` route as a multipart
     form encoded upload specifying two parameters: `file` which is the encoded data and `target` which is the given `Space`s or `Building`s
     keystring.

## Buildings Collection [/api/v1/buildings{?limit,cursor}]
### Get all Buildings [GET]
Use this to retrieve a list of all `Buildings` in the RealMassive database. 
### Notes
* This API call isn’t optimized for speed, it’s optimized for sifting through the entire `Building` Collection. For speedy searches, you’ll want
  to use `Building` search.
* Your results will be batched (the default batch size is 70).
* To receive the next batch of results, rerun the query with the cursor provided in the results.
* You may limit your batch size in the query by passing the optional `limit` parameter.

+ Parameters
    + limit = `70` (optional, integer, `3`) ... Number of results to return in this batch
    + cursor (optional, cursor) ... Provide the cursor to continue to your next batch of results

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# Group Portfolios
## Introduction
Our Portfolio resource enables you to create market surveys or “portfolios,” which  are lists of spaces under consideration. You can use the 
Portfolio API call to share, manage, and edit portfolio spaces. Portfolios are built for collaboration, so the portfolio owner and collaborators
are able to make notes and edit space details for properties listed in their portfolios. Portfolios only include copies (denorms) of the original
space listings, so changes and notes within the portfolios won’t affect the public (master)  space listings. However changes to master listings
will be automatically carried over to portfolios, as long as they do not conflict with space details that have been entered by the portfolio owner
or collaborators. If they do conflict with the portfolio owner’s information, the portfolio owner will be asked to accept or discard the changes
manually.

## Portfolio Attributes

## Group HTTP Transport Details

### Requests
#### GET
When you search, using any of the ```/search``` routes, you will receive a cursor in the payload. This cursor can sometimes be very long (eg >1300 characters) which may be
too long for some browsers. Instead of passing the cursor on the URI you may also pass it in the HTTP request header titled "Cursor".

#### POST
When you POST data to the server, make sure you send it in the request body and make sure it's properly-formatted JSON. Also, set 'Content-Type' to 'application/json'.

### Request Headers
Several specific HTTP request headers are used as described in the following table:

| Header  | Supported Values  | Description | Required? | 
|---|---|---|---|
| `Accept`  | Comma-delimited list of media types or media type patterns.  | Indicates to the server what media type(s) this client is prepared to accept.  | Recommended, on requests that will produce a response message body.  |
| `Authorization` | "Basic " plus username and password (per RFC 2617).  | Identifies the authorized user making this request.  | Yes, on all requests not using OAuth.  |

### Response Headers
API calls are rate limited. Read the response headers to determine how many calls you have left for a given time period

| Response Header | Meaning |
| --------------- | ------- |
| `Cache-Control` | We cache agressively for best performance |
| `Content-Encoding` | We gzip most responses for reduced payload size |
| `Content-Type` | The format of the data we're returning, usually, "application/json" |
| `Status` | See the Standard HTTP Status Codes below |
| `X-Ratelimit-Limit` | You starting rate limit for this time period|
| `X-Ratelimit-Remaining` | How many API calls left you have this rate period. |


### Standard HTTP Status Codes
API calls will return standard HTTP response codes as described in the following table, under the conditions listed in the description.

| HTTP Status | Description |
|---|---|
| 200 OK | The request was successfully completed. |
| 400 Bad Request | The request could not be processed because it contains missing or invalid information (such as validation error on an input field, a missing required value, and so on). |
| 401 Unauthorized | The authentication credentials included with this request are missing or invalid. |
| 403 Forbidden | The server recognized your credentials, but you do not possess authorization to perform this request. |
| 404 Not Found | The request specified a URI of a resource that does not exist.|
| 405 Method Not Allowed | The HTTP verb specified in the request (DELETE, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT) is not supported for this request URI. |
| 406 Not Acceptable | The resource identified by this request is not capable of generating a representation corresponding to one of the media types in the Accept header of the request.
| 500 Internal Server Error | The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. |
| 501 Not Implemented | The server does not (currently) support the functionality required to fulfill the request. |
| 503 Service Unavailable | The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.|

### Error Response Message Bodies
#### Introduction
Successful requests will generally return an HTTP status code of 200 (OK), 201 (Created), or 204 (No Content), to indicate that the requested action has been successfully performed. In addition, they might include a response message body (with an appropriate media type) containing a representation of the requested information. 

In the case that something goes wrong, we’ve included codes for communicating the various underlying causes by various HTTP status codes in
the range 400-499 (for client side errors) or 500-599 (for server side problems). Each API call documented here, lists the possible status codes
returned by that request type. If a response is returned with an error status code (400-499 or 500-599), the server should also return a response
message body containing an encoded description describing what went wrong. The text values of such messages might be used, for example, to
communicate with a human user of the client side application.
